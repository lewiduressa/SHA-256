"# SHA_256" 

This is my version of SHA-256. I worked on this just as a side project to learn what really makes the algorithm such a secure hashing algorithm. While doing so, I learned a great deal about the function and even about crypto-currencies (like Bitcoin) that depend on this algorithm. By building it myself, I learned that what makes this algorithm secure is not that it's impossible to break, but that it takes an infeasible amount of work to reverse engineer the original input. Which I find interesting as quantum computing is becoming a reality now and is a direct threat to this algorithm and all digital security in general
